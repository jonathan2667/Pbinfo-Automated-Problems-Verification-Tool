# PBInfoBot: Automated Problem Verification Tool ðŸ¤–

## Overview
PBInfoBot is a sophisticated Python script developed to automate problem verification on the "pbinfo.ro" website. This tool employs a dual-account system, leveraging one account for dummy interactions and another for main operations. By intelligently selecting users who have encountered problems, PBInfoBot streamlines the verification process and ensures fairness by preventing repeated requests to the same user.

## Key Features
- **Automation:** Seamlessly handles interactions on "pbinfo.ro" to verify problem solutions.
- **Dual-Account System:** Utilizes two pbinfo accounts for distinct roles, optimizing workflow.
- **User Selection:** Smartly selects five users with reported problems for efficient verification.
- **Redundancy Prevention:** Avoids redundant requests by tracking and managing user interactions.

## Usage
1. Ensure dependencies (`selenium`, `webdriver`) are installed.
2. Run the script and follow prompts for necessary inputs.

## Note
While functional, the code may benefit from further optimization and refactoring for enhanced readability and performance.

Happy Botting! ðŸš€
